Differences Between Gazebo Simulation and Raspberry Pi Robot
Hardware Performance:

Gazebo: Runs on your computer with potentially much higher processing power
Raspberry Pi: Has limited CPU and memory resources which can affect the controller's performance
Adjustment: Reduce the control loop frequency on the Raspberry Pi if you notice high CPU usage:

Python

self.update_rate = 0.2  # seconds (slower on Raspberry Pi)
Sensor Timing and Accuracy:

Gazebo: Sensor data is typically perfect with minimal noise
Raspberry Pi: Real sensors have noise, delays, and inaccuracies
Adjustment: Add more filtering for sensor readings on the physical robot:

Python

# For Raspberry Pi, increase filter coefficients
self.derivative_filter = 0.7  # More filtering for real-world noise
self.filter_coefficient = 0.4  # More filtering for outputs
Motor Response:

Gazebo: Motors typically respond instantly and perfectly to commands
Raspberry Pi: Real motors have latency, momentum, and may not respond linearly
Adjustment: Modify PID gains for real hardware:

Python

# For Raspberry Pi, often need lower Kp and higher Ki
self.linear_pid = PIDController(kp=0.6, ki=0.15, kd=0.05, output_min=0.0, output_max=self.max_linear_speed)
self.angular_pid = PIDController(kp=0.8, ki=0.15, kd=0.1, output_min=-1.0, output_max=1.0)
Time Synchronization:

Gazebo: Simulation time might not run at wall-clock speed
Raspberry Pi: Real-time constraints apply
Adjustment: For the Raspberry Pi, use ROS time instead of system time:

Python

# Replace time.time() calls with:
current_time = self.get_clock().now().to_msg().sec + (self.get_clock().now().to_msg().nanosec / 1e9)
Physical Constraints:

Gazebo: Fewer physical limitations (e.g., battery life, overheating)
Raspberry Pi: Battery limitations, motor heating issues
Adjustment: Add constraints for physical robot:

Python

self.max_linear_speed = 0.5  # Lower max speed for physical robot
self.linear_speed_increment = 0.0005  # Slower acceleration for physical robot
Network Communication:

Gazebo: Usually minimal network latency
Raspberry Pi: Potential Wi-Fi or network delays
Adjustment: Add timeout handling:

Python

# Add to odom_callback
self.last_odom_time = self.get_clock().now()

# Add to timer_callback
current_time = self.get_clock().now()
if (current_time - self.last_odom_time).nanoseconds/1e9 > 0.5:  # 500ms timeout
    self.get_logger().warning('Odometry timeout! Using reduced speeds.')
    linear_output = linear_output * 0.5  # Reduce speed if odometry is delayed
Wheel Slippage:

Gazebo: Usually perfect traction
Raspberry Pi: Real robots can slip on surfaces
Adjustment: Add detection for wheel slippage:

Python

# Add to odom_callback
if self.current_linear_speed < 0.01 and self.target_linear_speed > 0.1:
    self.get_logger().warning('Possible wheel slippage detected')
    # Could implement recovery behavior here
Startup/Shutdown Considerations:

Gazebo: Clean shutdown is usually guaranteed
Raspberry Pi: May need emergency stops or recovery
Adjustment: Add emergency stop functionality:

Python

# Add emergency stop detection
def emergency_stop(self):
    stop_msg = Twist()
    self.publisher_.publish(stop_msg)
    self.get_logger().error('EMERGENCY STOP TRIGGERED')
    # Could add code to notify user or execute recovery behavior
CPU Load Management:

Gazebo: CPU load affects simulation speed but not robot behavior
Raspberry Pi: High CPU load can cause control loop delays
Adjustment: Add CPU load monitoring:
